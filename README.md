# UPennRobotics-Coursera
This repo contains 3 courses from UPenn`s robotics specialization at Coursera.
## Aerial Robotics 
This course Introduces the basics of robotics and Matlab. Based on the kinematics of a quadrotor, implemented trajectory control in 3 dimensions.
## Computational Motion Planning
This course focuses on robot motion planning. It covers basic path planning algorithms and provides a Matlab simulation environment.
## Perception and Learning
This course includes several estimation methods commonly applied in robotics. Particularly, the Kalman filter and particle filter are covered in this course.
